The goal of apr is to bring the goodness of [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) to R. R provides multidimensional arrays out of the box, but many of the table stakes for array programming are missing. This package seeks to fill that gap.

## Installation

You can install the development version of apr like so:

``` r
pak::pak("11rchitwood/apr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(apr)
apr_shape(Titanic)
```
