The goal of apr is to bring the goodness of [Iversonian array languages](https://github.com/codereport/array-language-comparisons) to R. R provides multidimensional arrays out of the box, but many of the table stakes for array programming are missing. This package seeks to fill that gap while still adhering to R idioms and conventions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of apr like so:

``` r
pak::pak("11rchitwood/apr")
```
