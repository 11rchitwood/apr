## Test-Driven Development

Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) when developing a new feature.

1. Write a test for the new feature and watch it fail (red).
2. Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass (green).
3. Clean the code while keeping the test green (refactor).

Repeat the process for any new features or changes.

## Code Review

When suggesting changes during code review, use TDD as well. That is, make the suggested change explicit by writing a failing test. Then, follow the TDD process to make the test pass and refactor the code as needed.
